                  On the login page, click "Forgot your password?" and follow the instructions. You'll need access to the email address or phone number associated with your account to reset your password.

                  Make sure you're using the correct email/phone and password combination. Check if Caps Lock is on. If you still can't log in, try the "Forgot your password?" option. If that doesn't work, your account may have been temporarily locked for security reasons.

                <p>
                  Our Community Standards outline what is and isn’t allowed on peoplechat. They’re designed to create a safe environment where people can express themselves. Key areas include violence and criminal behavior, safety, objectionable content, integrity and authenticity, and respecting intellectual property.
                </p>

                <h4 className="font-bold mt-4">How do I report content that violates Community Standards?</h4>
                <p>
                  Click the "Report" link near the content you want to report. Follow the prompts to select the type of violation. Reports are confidential, and the person you report won’t know who reported them.
                </p>

                <h4 className="font-bold mt-4">What happens when I report something?</h4>
                <p>
                  Our team reviews reported content to determine if it violates our Community Standards. If it does, we’ll remove it. In some cases, we may also disable the account that posted it. You’ll be notified of the outcome of your report.
                </p>

                <h4 className="font-bold mt-4">Can I appeal if my content is removed?</h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. If your content is removed, you’ll receive a notification with an option to appeal. We’ll review your appeal and restore your content if we determine it doesn’t violate our standards.
